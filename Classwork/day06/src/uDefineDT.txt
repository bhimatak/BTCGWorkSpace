keywords -> struct, union, enum


declare

struct structName
{
	collection of diff P dts	
};

ex:

struct employee
{
	int empid;       ==members of the structure
	int ephone;     ==members of the structure
	char ename[50];==members of the structure
	char eaddr[200];==members of the structure
	char egender;==members of the structure
};



structure padding 



struct Employee
{
	int eID;
	int ePhone;
	char eName[50];
	char eAddr[200];
	char eGender;

};

to use the members of the struct
we use the following operator/symbols

1)  . -> dot operator => normal decalaration
2) -> arrow operator => if the structure variable is defined as pointer



//dec of variable of UDT
struct Employee Emp1, Emp2;

Emp1.eID = 101;
Emp1.ePhone = 9999999;
strcpy(Emp1.eName,"Bhima");
strcpy(Emp1.eAddr,"Karnataka");
Emp1.eGender = 'M';


printf("\n%d", Emp1.eID);
printf("\n%s", Emp.eName);



int a;

a = 10;
